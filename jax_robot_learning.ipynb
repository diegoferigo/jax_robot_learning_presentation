    "During this series of presentations, people often presented worked performed in the past, highlighting methods and results achieved so far.\n",
    "This presentation is centered on methods I've used during my PhD, but this time it is forward looking. It will not present achieved results but rather provide an overview on methods that I believe can simplify the life of researchers working on the boundary between robotics and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AMI, recently we have been embracing more and more the robot learning paradigm, and I believe that we have room of improvement about how we approach and prototype novel applications. So far, we often choose to rely on existing solutions that are not necessarily designed to be used within a robot learning architecture, obtaining suboptimal performance and possibly limiting the formulation of novel solutions to the problems at hand.\n",

    "## 1. What is JAX\n",
    "\n",
    "JAX is a framework exposing a [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)-compatible APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/469199/231703935-da5ecebc-778a-4419-8ee4-f208e4506911.svg\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "                                                    \n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prototyping is easy: familiar APIs and rapid idea-to-implementation process thanks to Python.\n",
    "- Speeding up computation is possible: code properly structured can be compiled to machine code in just-in-time (JIT) with `jax.jit`.\n",
    "- Write code once, run it on CPUs / GPUs / TPUs thanks to XLA.\n",
    "- Write parallel algorithms as a data flow operating on a single element, and seamlessly run it concurrently by transforming it with `jax.vmap` (no need to learn CUDA kernels).\n",
    "- Write code operating on heterogeous data structures thanks to `PyTree` generalization.\n",
    "- All implemented APIs support automatic differentiation (AD) that can be used for scientific programming (not only ML!).\n",
    "- Excellent debugging capability:\n",
    "  - [NaNs detection](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/flags.html),\n",
    "  - [`jax.debug.print`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/print_breakpoint.html) inside compiled code,\n",
    "  - [`jax.experimental.host_callback`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.experimental.host_callback.html) inside compiled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JAX is a new framework and although the ecosystem is growing, is not as popular as PyTorch.\n",
    "- Code transformed with `jit` and `vmap` must be developed entirely in JAX, in most cases you cannot use third-party libraries.\n",
    "- Branching and looping is supported (`if`, `for,`, `while`, etc.) but low-level [`jax.lax`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html#control-flow-operators) calls have to be used.\n",
    "- When dealing with physics equations, 64 bit support has to be enabled.\n",

We have only seen how to sample a trajectory starting from a single $\\mathbf{x}_0$, but we can use `jax.vmap` to sample concurrently hundred or thousand of trajectories from different initial conditions on hardware acceleratos.\n",
